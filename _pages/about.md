 I am a brazilian Scientist currently based at Cork, Ireland. I have a bachelor degree in Biotechnology at the State University of the West Zone, of Rio de Janeiro State in 2009, masters in Computational Biology and Systems at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute in 2012, and a doctorate degree in Computational and System Biology in the same institute. During my doctorate I witnessed the development of sequencing technology needed for the explosion of microbiome studies, and started to work with environmental metagenomes at the very start of my career. In 2015 I was granted with an international joint-PhD fellowship to continue my work with bacterial genomics and public health at Utrecht University/Holland, which was my very first international experience. 
  
  
  In 2017 I decided to change my study subject from public health to biotechnology, so I started a post-doctoral fellowship sponsored by FAPESP, the most prestigious grant agency in Brazil, and started to study the rumen and fecal microbiome of beef cattle, and its influence in the cattle phenotype. This research line proved to be a succesfull one, allowing us to aprove projects in different grant agencies and to publish studies regarding different layers of genomic information of beef cattle, such as genomics, metagenomics, metabolomics and miRnomics. In 2019 I was granted with an international joint Post-doctoral fellowship to apply Machine learning approaches to analyze microbiome and cattle data at Cork Institute of Techonology, Ireland.
  
  Since 2020, I took over a Marie Curie funded Post-doctoral position at Cork Institute of techonolgy, in the Computer Science Department. Currently I'm studying the fecal microbiome diversity of USA Angus breed, reconstructing Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs), bacterial genes and functions and trying to understand how these microorganisms could influence weight gain and other growth phenotypes. I am involved in several projects with international collaborators, such as the antibiotic resistome in oceans ([ResistomeDB](https://resistomedb.com/)), the human microbiome (work in progress), different projects regarding brazilian beef cattle, and also the influence of the nasopharyngeal microbiome in the severity of COVID-19.
