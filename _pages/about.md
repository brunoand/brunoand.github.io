<div style="text-align: justify">I am a Brazilian Scientist currently based in Cork, Ireland. I have a bachelor's degree in Biotechnology at the State University of the West Zone of Rio de Janeiro State in 2009, master's in Computational Biology and Systems at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute in 2012, and a doctorate in Computational and System Biology in the same institute. During my doctorate, I witnessed the development of sequencing technology needed for the explosion of microbiome studies and started to work with environmental metagenomes at the very start of my career. In 2015 I was granted an international joint-PhD fellowship to continue my work with bacterial genomics and public health at Utrecht University/Holland, my first international experience.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In 2017 I decided to change my study subject from public health to biotechnology, so I started a post-doctoral fellowship sponsored by FAPESP, the most prestigious grant agency in Brazil, to study the rumen and fecal microbiomes of beef cattle and its influence on its phenotypes. This research line proved to be a successful one, allowing us to approve projects in different grant agencies and publish studies regarding different layers of genomic information of beef cattle, such as genomics, metagenomics, and metabolomics. In 2019 I was granted an international joint Post-doctoral fellowship to apply Machine learning approaches to analyze microbiome and cattle data at Cork Institute of Technology, Ireland.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Since 2020, I took over a Marie Curie funded Post-doctoral position at Cork Institute of Technology, in the Computer Science Department. I'm currently studying the fecal microbiome diversity of the USA Angus breed, reconstructing Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs), bacterial genes and functions, and trying to understand how these microorganisms could influence weight gain and other growth phenotypes. I am involved in several projects with international collaborators, such as the antibiotic resistome in oceans (ResistomeDB), the human microbiome (work in progress), different projects regarding Brazilian beef cattle, and the influence of the nasopharyngeal microbiome in the severity of COVID-19.</div>
