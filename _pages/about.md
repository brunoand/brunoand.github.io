I'm a Brazilian scientist, born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, currently living in Berlin. I got a bachelor degree in Biomedicine from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro State ([UNIRIO](http://www.unirio.br/)) in 2007, and a Masters in Cellular and Molecular Biology from Oswaldo Cruz Foundation ([FIOCRUZ](https://portal.fiocruz.br/)) in 2010. In 2014 I got my doctorate degree in Computational and System Biology from Oswaldo Cruz Foundation ([FIOCRUZ](https://portal.fiocruz.br/)). During my doctorate I witnessed the growth of Next Generating Sequencing (NGS), working with 454 sequenced ocean metagenomes and studying the potential of secondary metabolism of aquatic microorganisms. In 2015 I was granted with an international postdoc fellowship and moved to Berlin, where I worked at the Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB), in collaboration with The Berlin Center for Genomics in Biodiversity Research (BeGenDiv).  In 2017 I moved to Cologne, where I worked at the bioinformatics core facility from the Max Plank Institute for Biology of Ageing (MPI-AGE) for 2 years. Since 2019 I have a postdoc position at the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rebrucke (DIfE) in the Department of Molecular Epidemiology (MEP). Currently I’m trying to understand better the influence of the gut microbiome on cardiometabolic diseases on EPIC-POTSDAM cohort study. I’m involved in several projects from our department but also external collaborations, including the study of the antibiotic resistome in oceans (ResistomeDB) and also in the human microbiome. Since my bachelor thesis, studying parasite protozoa genomes, I always had a passion for the microbiological world and its relation to human health.
